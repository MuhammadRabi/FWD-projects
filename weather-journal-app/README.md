# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

###

first of all I have selected my variables like apikey and url of api

then I have added eventlistener on the button to trigger the process once it is clicked

then I passed the required parameters in my callback function link myUrl and myApiKey

and finally I created the updateUI function to write the retrieved data from server and right it down in html

## server side

1. I installed Node.js, Express and corr packages through NPM
2. I aquired the packages to be operational.
3. I have specified the current project file.
4. I have established a server connection at port 8000 and listened to it.
5. I constructed the GET and POST routes through the server and API
6. I pushed all the data as once through my projectData array
